Working with several languages
=============================================

**This page is being updated. Will be finished soon.**

If you need to publish information in several languages in Omnia, you start with setting up the languages you need in Omnia Admin.

To publish pages in more than one language, you use variations. The variations (languages in this case) needed, are set up in the publishing app settings, meaning each publishing app can have it's own variations settings.

For more information about variations, see: :doc:`Language version of a page </pages/language-versions-of-a-page/index>`
