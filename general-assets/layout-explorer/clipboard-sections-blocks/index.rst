Clipboard for sections and blocks
=======================================

Using this feature, you can copy sections and blocks between pages or page types. You must be able to use Design Mode to use the clipboard.

The omnia clipboard exists within a tenant, a domain and a computer. So if you're an editor using more than one computer, you will have a separate clipboards for each computer, even if you're working with the same tenant.

The clipboard is available here:
