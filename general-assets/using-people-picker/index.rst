Using the people picker
=============================================

**This page is just started. Will be finished soon.**

The people picke, sometimes called the identity picker, is used in many places in Omnia.

(Image to be added).

Normally, single users, security groups and Microsoft 365 groups can be added here (In Omnia on-prem, Microsoft 365 groups canâ€™t be used). There are a few excepetions where only single users can be added.
