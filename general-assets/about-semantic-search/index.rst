About semantic search
===================================

Semantic search is available in Omnia 7.8 and later. Prerequisite: the tenand feature "Semantic search" must be active.

**This page is just started. More information will be added soon.**

**Very important!** The semantic search will soon be developed further in Omnia but for now it does **not support security trimming**. Therefore, use semantic search only for common information that anyone in the organization have permission to read. If pages and documents should available (indexed) for semantic search can be set at page collection level for pages, and in document types for controlled documents. Semantic search does not work for other types of documents yet.
