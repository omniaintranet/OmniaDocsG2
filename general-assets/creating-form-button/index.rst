Creating a form using an action button
========================================================

In Omnia 7.6 and later, an action button can be placed on any publishing page, to make it possible to create a form to be used in a publishing app.

It's meant to be faster and easier, so the options are a bit limited compaired to creating forms using the options in Omnia Admin.

You must be publishing app administrator for the app you create the form for, to be able to use the button.

The button can be formatted in many ways. In this example we just use a crude form.

The options can also be set up up by an administrator in a number of ways, so what is shown here it's just an example.

Here's how to create a form using an action button:

1. Click the button.
