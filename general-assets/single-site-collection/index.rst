Single site collection
=====================================

**This description is just started. Will be edited and expanded soon.**

Available in Omnia 7.11 and later.

When absolute security is needed, Omnia can be run in Single site collection mode, but works then quite differently. For example:

+ No new sites can be created within the Omnia UI.
+ Follow site can not be used.
+ Document management and Process management must be used within a publishing app.

Sites must be created outside of Omnia and can then be attached to Omnia. After attaching a site to Omnia, the site works fully as an Omnia publishing site.

Activate Single site collection
**********************************
Single site collection should be activated on a new tenant only.

Here's how:

1. Activate the tenant feature "Web Content Management core (Sites.Selected)".
2. Use "Sites.Selected" in tenant settings: System > Microsoft 365 > Sites.Selected.
