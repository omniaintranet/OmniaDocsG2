Use the document picker this way:

1. Select tab if more than one is shown.
2. Select a document.
3. Click "OK".

If the list is long, use the navigation at the bottom of the page to go between pages:

Depending on settings, a search can be available, and it can also be possible to filter the list on a property, in this example on document owner. It's also posible to set a date interval for when the document was updated.
