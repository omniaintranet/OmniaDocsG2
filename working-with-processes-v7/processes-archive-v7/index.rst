Processes archive
================================================

When a process is unpublished a copy is placed in the archive - if the Process Type used is set up for archiving. See this page for more information about that: :doc:`Process types </admin-settings/tenant-settings/process-management/process-types/index>`

This page describes how this works in Omnia 7.0 and later.

The link to the archive is shown under Settings for Process Management: :doc:`Process Management - Settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/process-management/settings/index>`

Note that the archive is a separate site with it's own permissions. Normally just a few administrators can access the archive.

In the archive, the processes there can be displayed, but not retrieved.

Archived processes can be made available, if needed, through a Process Rollup block.
