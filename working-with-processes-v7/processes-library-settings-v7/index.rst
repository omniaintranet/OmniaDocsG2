Permissions
************
If Process management is set up for using permission groups, you can, as an administrator (Owner) of the teamsite, edit these permissions.

**Note!** Permissions for the Processes library is NOT inherited from the teamsite's permissions, they are always separate. **Also Note!** Only Sharepoint users can be added here (not Omnia users), and users or groups must be permissions enabled to show up in the list.

Do the following:

1. Click "Permissions" in the Processes library

Something like the following is shown:

.. image:: process-library-settings-permissions-details-v7.png

You add/remove groups and/or users to these fields the same way as other people filds.

Note that external users that has been invited in Entra ID can be added here as well. Users invited this way can log in with their own Microsoft 365 account.
