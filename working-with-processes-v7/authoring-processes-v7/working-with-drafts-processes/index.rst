Working with draft processes
=======================================================

"Drafts" is used when creating and editing drafts for new processes or when updating an existing process for a new edition.

When a process is published (approved for publication) it is removed from Drafts and is available on the "Published" tab. 

Process Draft list options
****************************
All active draft processes are displayed in the list and a number of columns are shown. A very important columns is "Status" where messages of the status of the process can be shown, for example if the process is checked out to someone (meaning only that person can edit the process) or if the processes is being published.
