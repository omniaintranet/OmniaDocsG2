Create new draft from a published process
========================================================

The work on a draft process for a new edition can be started whenever it’s convenient. The existing published edition is still available for readers until it’s replaced, when the new edition is published.

To create a new draft of a published process, do the following:

1.	Open the PUBLISHED tab.
2.	Click the dot menu for the process.
3.	Select "Create Draft".

The new draft is created and the DRAFTS tab is automatically activated. The work on the new draft is done exactly as the first time. That a process has been published before does not make any difference.

**Note!** There can be only one draft of a given process. If there already is a draft for the process and an author tries to create another, a message is shown stating that it's not possible.
