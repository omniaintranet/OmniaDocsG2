Accessibility
===========================================

Omnia is WCAG 2.1aa compliant. The accessibility features are built in from the start. A user can decide to turn these on at any time.

It's up to each user to do that in the User profile menu:

Select "Use accessibility features".

Besides that, it's up to administrators of a specific, customer implementation, to set up look and feel in a way that high accessibility is achived.
