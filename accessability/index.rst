Accessibility
===========================================

**This page is being edited.**

Omnia is WCAG 2.1aa compliant. The accessibility features are available from start. A user can decide to turn these on at any time.

It's up to each user to do that in the User profile menu:

.. image:: accessability-profile.png

Select "Use accessibility features".

.. image:: accessability-profile-select.png

The following is then turned on:

+ Tab selections are bolder.
+ All links contain underscore.
+ Themes with low contrast can no longer be used.
+ Opacity is generally removed.
+ Sticky tooltips are activated.

Besides that, it's up to administrators of a specific, customer implementation, to set up look and feel in a way that high accessibility is achived.
