Accessibility
===========================================

Omnia is WCAG 2.1aa compliant. The accessibility features are available from start. A user can decide to turn these on at any time.

It's up to each user to do that in the User profile menu:

.. image:: accessability-profile.png

Select "Use accessibility features".

.. image:: accessability-profile-select.png

The following is then turned on:

+ The accessibility theme.
+ Underscore for some links (See more about this below).
+ Sticky tool tips.

The accessibility theme
**************************
How visible the differences are can differ a lot depending on how the default themes for the business profile are set up, and how the themes are used for blocks and for backgrounds on pages, but generally contrasts are higher. Here's an example for the breadcrump.

Accessibility not turned on:

.. image:: access-not.png

Accessibility turned on:

.. image:: access-on.png

It's a small but important difference.

Generally, it's up to administrators of a specific, customer implementation, to set up look and feel in a way that high accessibility is achieved. 

In Omnia admin, theme mappings can be set up between the "accessibility theme" and other themes, if needed. That option can be used by a business profile administrator and is found here, for a business profile:

.. image:: admin-access-settings-menu.png

Here's an example of a mapping:
   
.. image:: admin-access-settings-settings.png

Underscore for some links
***************************
Links, where it's not obvious that they are just links, are marked with underscore.

Here's an example where underscore is added to show that this is a link. In certain lists, you can click a colleagues name to open the profile card. When Accessibility features are NOT activated, there's no underscore:

.. image:: underscore-not.png

But when Accessibility features ARE active, this page is shown with the names underscored:

.. image:: names-underscore.png

When it comes to navigation, underscore is usually added when accessibility features are activated. Here's an example WITHOUT accessibility features:

..image:: navigation-no-access.png

And this is WITH accessibility features:

..image:: navigation-access-on.png

Some links are already marked with underscore, mainly links in areas where content is edited by the RTF Editor, so there is no differne aither accessibility features are on or not.

Other links are deemed obvious, for example where the Quick links block is used.

.. image:: quik-links-block.png

Meaning it looks the same accessibility features on or off.

*****************
The sticky tooltips functionality is being updated and expanded in Omnia. This section will be updated when a new version is implemented.
