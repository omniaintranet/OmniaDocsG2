Accessibility
===========================================

**This page is being edited, will be finished soon.**

Omnia is WCAG 2.1aa compliant. The accessibility features are available from start. A user can decide to turn these on at any time.

It's up to each user to do that in the User profile menu:

.. image:: accessability-profile.png

Select "Use accessibility features".

.. image:: accessability-profile-select.png

The following is then turned on:

+ The accessibility theme.
+ Underscore for som links (See more about this below).
+ Sticky tool tips.

The accessibility theme
**************************
How visible the differences are can differ a lot depending on how the default themes for the business profile are set up, and how the themes are used for blocks and for backgrounds on pages, but generally contrasts are higher. Here's an example for the breadcrump.

Accessibility not turned on:

.. image:: access-not.png

Accessibility turned on:

.. image:: access-on.png

It's a small but important difference.

Generally, it's up to administrators of a specific, customer implementation, to set up look and feel in a way that high accessibility is achieved. 

In Omnia admin, theme mappings can be set up between the "accessibility theme" and other themes, if needed. That option can be used by a business profile administrator and is found here, for a business profile:

.. image:: admin-access-settings-menu.png

Here's an example of a mapping:
   
.. image:: admin-access-settings-settings.png

Underscore for links
***********************
Links, where it's not obvious that they are just links, are marked with underscore.

Some links are already marked with underscore, mainly links in in areas where content is edited by the RTF Editor. Other links are deemed obvious, for example where the Quick links block is used.

(Image will be added)

In other cases, underscore is added to show that this is a link.
