Current user language
========================

Omnia users can set the current user language, if needed.

**Note!** This setting is for system labels, and a few other labels, for example:

+ Tenant and business profile names.
+ Publishing app title and description.
+ Navigation node titles.
+ Page type's titles.

This is how:

1. Open My profile.

2. Open the list for language settings.

3. Select language.

The list contains all languages that are set up in Omnia admin, see: :doc:`Regional settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/settings/regional-settings/index>`

The setting is saved automatically and is valid over sessions, meaning until language is set next time.
