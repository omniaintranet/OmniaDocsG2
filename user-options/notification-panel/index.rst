Notification panel
===========================================

A noticification panel can be present in the action panel or on any page. The purpose is to help users find out what information has been updated within different areas of the intranet.

Several different notification panels can be created for different purposes, where one of them can be displayed in the action menu. Others can be displayed through a block, on any page.

A number - 1 in the example below - indicates the number of new messages for the user:

Here's an example of what can be found in a notification panel:
