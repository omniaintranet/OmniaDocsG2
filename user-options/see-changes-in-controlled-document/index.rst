See changes in a controlled document
=======================================

This feature must be activated and it requires a paid subscription with Draftable.

When the option is activated it's possible to see the changes that has been made in the latest edition of a controlled document, compared to the last edition before that. The documents does not need to be open and even PDF:s can be compared.

If there is only one edition of the document, the option is simply not shown.

The option is available in the information window of a document, through the i icon:

Remember that there must be at least two editions of a document for this option to show up, and that it requires a paid subscription with Draftable.
