Working with Layouts
================================================

**This documentation is just started.**

You can create different layouts for a variety of features in Omnia. Much of the functionality is generic, and this page describes the general approach.

When working with the navigation bar layout for mega menu objects, you can use all available section and block options in Omnia.

Creating a Layout
*******************
Start by clicking the ➕ (Add section) icon.

.. image:: layout-1-new.png

Next, select a section layout, just as you would when working with a Page Type.

.. image:: layout-2-new.png

Then, continue building your layout by adding sections and blocks as needed.

For detailed guidance, see the following pages:

+ :doc:`Working with sections and blocks </pages/page-types/working-with-sections-and-blocks/index>`
+ :doc:`Settings for sections </pages/page-types/section-settings/index>`
+ :doc:`Working with blocks </blocks/working-with-blocks/index>`

**Tip**: You can create a mega menu–style navigation by using a Page Rollup block with the scope set to **Navigation path** and **Navigation View**.

Saving a Draft and Publishing
---------------------------------
Saving a draft, discarding changes, and publishing a layout work similarly to how pages are managed.

For more information, see:

+ :doc:`Edit a page </pages/edit-page/index>`
+ :doc:`Publish page changes </pages/publish-page-changes/index>`

**Note**: Layout publishing is similar to page publishing, but not identical. Some page-specific features, such as scheduled publishing, are not available for layouts.

Deleting a Layout
*********************
If you need to delete a layout, you’ll find the Delete layout option in the menu:

Different Layouts for Different Screen Sizes
***********************************************
By default, layouts are designed for computer screens.

You can preview how your layout appears on smaller screen sizes and create custom layouts for specific devices if needed.

To create layouts for other screen sizes:

1. Select **Screen size**.

.. image:: layout-screen-size-new.png

2. Open the list and select **Create new layout**.

.. image:: layout-screen-size-new-layout-new.png

You can then work with the layout for each screen size just as described above.
