Working with Layouts
================================================

**This documentation is just started.**

You can create different layouts for a number of features in Omnia. A great dela of what you can do is generic and that is what is described here.

When working with the navigation bar layout for mega menu objects, you can use all options for sections and blocks available in Omnia.

Start by clicking the x symbol to add a section.

.. image:: layout-1-new.png

Then select section layout, just like you would do when working with a Page Type.

.. image:: layout-2-new.png

Then continue building up the layout using sections and blocks.

For more information, see these pages:

+ :doc:`Working with sections and blocks </pages/page-types/working-with-sections-and-blocks/index>`
+ :doc:`Settings for sections </pages/page-types/section-settings/index>`
+ :doc:`Working with blocks </blocks/working-with-blocks/index>`

**A tip:** One way of creating a mega menu-like navigation is to use a Page Rollup, with scope "Navigation path" and "Navigation View".

Saving a draft and publishing
---------------------------------
Saving a draft, discarding changes and finally publishing the layout, works very similar to working with pages.

.. image:: layout-3-new.png

For more information, see these pages:

+ :doc:`Edit a page </pages/edit-page/index>`
+ :doc:`Publish page changes </pages/publish-page-changes/index>`

But note that it's very similar, not exactly the same. Some options for pages are not available here (like scheduled publishing).

One thing that is perhaps not that obvious is how to delete a layout, if needed. You will find that option in the menu:

.. image:: layout-delete-new.png

Different layouts for different screen sizes
*********************************************
The default screen size is for computer screens. You can use the other screen sizes to check what the layout will look like in smaller sizes, and decide if specific layouts for other sizes are needed.

If you would like to add different layouts for one or more of the other scren sizes available, do the following:

1. Select Screen size.

.. image:: layout-screen-size-new.png

2. Open the list and select "Create new layout".

.. image:: layout-screen-size-new-layout-new.png

You work with the layout for the different screen sizes as described above.
