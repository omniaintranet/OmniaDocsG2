Using Media Picker
=============================================

The Media picker — sometimes referred to as the Image picker — is used to add images or videos to a block, or directly to page content via the RTF editor.

You can select an image:

+ From your local computer
+ From any central media location registered in Omnia Admin
+ By pasting an image from the clipboard

Additionally, extra media providers can be configured in Omnia Admin.

When the Media picker opens, a window similar to the one below is displayed:

To select an image, perform a search (if needed), click the image, and the image settings will be displayed. The available settings are the same for all images.

Available Providers
**********************
A number of media providers can be configured. Below are some common examples:

+ My computer – Paste an image from the clipboard or browse to select an image from your computer.
+ Central media bank – Browse or search libraries for images. Media bank settings are configured per business profile. Videos can also be stored and managed in SharePoint media libraries, including some Microsoft video editing options.
+ Bing – Requires the Bing feature to be active. You can search for any image or use predefined search categories (if set up). Administrators can configure Bing search categories in Omnia Admin. **Important**: Omnia automatically filters Bing results to display only images free to use.
+ Pexels – Requires the Pexels feature to be active. Only a search field is available for Pexels. **Important**: All images from Pexels are always free to use and edit.

File Size Larger Than Recommended
****************************************
If you select an image that exceeds the organization’s recommended file size, a warning will appear, allowing you to decide how to proceed. The definition of what is considered “too large,” along with the available options, is configured in Omnia Admin.

**Note**: In the Media block, a default scaling option can be set. When this is active, no “large image” warning is shown — all added images are automatically scaled to the default size.
