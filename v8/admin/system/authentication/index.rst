Authentification
=============================================

If Safari users in your organization have Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) enabled, this option must be turned on in Omnia.

You can also adjust the Omnia token lifetime if needed (default is 24 hours).

**Note!** This option is not available in Omnia OnPrem.
