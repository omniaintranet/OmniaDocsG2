Text translator
=======================================

A default Omnia translator is always available â€” no configuration is required to use it.

Azure Cognitive Services is also available, but requires a paid subscription. If you have an active Azure Cognitive Services subscription, you must add the corresponding settings here.

If you have installed another text translation service, enter similar settings for that provider.
