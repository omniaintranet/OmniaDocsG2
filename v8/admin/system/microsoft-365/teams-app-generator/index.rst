Teams app generator
=====================================

Use these options as a quick starting point for creating a new Teams app for Omnia, or for updating an existing one.

Generate Omnia app
**********************
Enter a title, description, and home URL, then click GENERATE.

The app is created and downloaded as a .zip file to your Downloads folder.

The app is ready for use immediately, but you may want to make additional adjustments using the Developer Portal.

Additional aettings (optional)
-------------------------------
You can make optional refinements to your app in the Developer Portal, such as adding icons or customizing branding.

Access the Developer Portal either as an app in Teams or at dev.teams.microsoft.com

1. Import the app you created (ignore initial errors; you’ll correct them below).
2. Go to **Branding**, and add both a Color icon and an Outline icon with the correct sizes, as specified there.
3. Make any other changes you wish to apply.
4. Download the updated app.

Publish the app (optional)
-----------------------------
These steps are optional, but required if you want users to access the app without installing it manually (which some users may not have permission to do).

1. Open Teams Administration in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
2. Go to **Teams apps** → **Manage apps**.
3. Upload your app.

**Note**: It may take some time before the app appears in the list. If you don’t see it immediately, wait a while and check again.

4. Create or select a Setup Policy.
5. Publish the app.

When published this way, the app is installed automatically for all users, or for the specific user group defined in the Setup Policy.

**Note**: It may take up to 24 hours before users can access the app in Teams.

Update existing app
***********************
If you already have an Omnia app and want to update it to the 6.10 (or later) standard, use the **Update Existing App** tab. The description indicates the purpose: “Ensure Omnia SSO and Omnia Teamwork tab for an existing app.”

To update an app:

1. Drag and drop your existing app file, or click **Browse** to upload it.
2. Click GENERATE.

The updated app is downloaded as a .zip file to your Downloads folder.
