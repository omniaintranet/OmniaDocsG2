SPFx instruction
=====================================

This is an instruction that may be needed for integration between Omnia and SharePoint team sites.

**Important note!** If running the tenant in monitoring mode, Omnia will not work inside SPFx as most options in SharePoint will not work.

**Also note!** Monitoring mode is SharePoint online functionality. There's a lot of information available on Microsoft pages regarding how this works. Search for "SharePoint monitoring mode".
