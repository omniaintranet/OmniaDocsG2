Shared links permissions
========================================

Use these settings to add and remove additional administrators for shared links, if needed. Only tenant administrators can use this setting. A tenant administrator can always work with shared links and don't need to be added here. 

To delete an administrator, just click the x. To add an administrator, add the name the same way as in other name fields.
