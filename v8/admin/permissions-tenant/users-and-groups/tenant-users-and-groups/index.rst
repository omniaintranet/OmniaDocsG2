Tenant
=====================================

Use these settings to add and remove tenant administrators. Only tenant administrators can use this setting. A tenant administrator can also edit all the settings for all business profiles within the tenant. 

To delete an administrator, just click the x. To add an administrator, add the name the same way as in other name fields.

Note! There must always be at least one tenant administrator. If there is only one, that administrator can not be removed until an additional administrator has been added.

If you see a field called "Username", it's a special case that can be necessary to handle when setting up a new tenant. As the user sync can't be executed until the tenant has been setup, you may need to add a tenant administrator in this field, in this special circumstance.

(Information about "Directory reader" will be added soon).
