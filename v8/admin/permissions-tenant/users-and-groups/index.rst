Users and groups
=====================================

The following permissions can be set here. Only tenant administrators can use these settings. 

You handle the fields the usual way in the people picker, see link beow for more information.

Tenant
**********
Use these settings to add and remove tenant administrators. A tenant administrator can also edit all the settings for all business profiles within the tenant. 

**Note!** There must always be at least one tenant administrator. If there is only one, that administrator can not be removed until an additional administrator has been added.

In the field "Directory reader" all users that should be able to list users in Omnia must be added. Users not added here can't use the people picker or see a list of users in the People rollup block. Groups can be added here as well, for example "Internal users", for all internal users. This can be a way of making sure external users, or some other type of users, can't list all users.

If you see a field called "Username", it's a special case that can be necessary to handle when setting up a new tenant. As the user sync can't be executed until the tenant has been setup, you may need to add a tenant administrator in this field, in this special circumstance.

Shared links permissions
***************************
Use these settings to add and remove additional administrators for shared links, if needed. A tenant administrator can always work with shared links and don't need to be added here. 

Announcements permissions
***************************
Use this setting to add and remove additional administrators for announcements, if needed. A tenant administrator can always work with announcements and don't need to be added here.
