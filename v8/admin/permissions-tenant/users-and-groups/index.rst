Users and groups
=====================================

The following permissions can be configured here. Only tenant administrators have access to these settings.

You manage the fields using the people picker — see the linked page below for more details.

Tenant
*********
Use these settings to add or remove tenant administrators. A tenant administrator has full access and can edit all settings for all business profiles within the tenant.

**Note**: There must always be at least one tenant administrator. If only one administrator exists, that user cannot be removed until an additional administrator has been added.

In the Directory reader field, add all users who should be able to list users in Omnia. Users not included here cannot use the people picker or see user lists in the People rollup block.

Groups can also be added — for example, “Internal users” — to ensure that certain user types, such as external users, cannot list all users.

If a field called Username appears, it’s a special case used during initial tenant setup. Since user synchronization cannot run until the tenant setup is complete, you may need to manually add a tenant administrator in this field during this step.

Shared links permissions
************************
Use these settings to add or remove additional administrators for shared links, if needed.

Tenant administrators automatically have full permissions for shared links and do not need to be added here.

Announcements Permissions
******************************
Use this setting to add or remove additional administrators for announcements, if needed.

Tenant administrators automatically have full permissions for announcements and do not need to be added here.
