Tenant
=====================================

Use these settings to add and remove tenant administrators and separate administrators for shared links and announcements, if needed. Only tenant administrators can use this setting. A tenant administrator can also edit all the settings for all business profiles within the tenant. 

To delete an administrator in any of the lists, just click the x. To add an administrator, add the name the same way as in other name fields.

Note! There must always be at least one tenant administrator. If there is only one, that administrator can not be removed until an additional administrator has been added.

If you see a field called "Username", as in the image above, it's a special case that can be necessary to handle when setting up a new tenant. As the user sync can't be executed until the tenant has been setup, you may need to add a tenant administrator in this field, in this special circumstance.

The semantic search reader setting
Semantic search is a new AI feature that can be available in Omnia 7.8 and later (if semantic search is activated in the tenant). Add the colleagues and groups that should be able to use semantic search. If a search block is set up with semantic search and certain users are not allowed to use the feature, they get empty search result if trying to use this search block. Also note that other permissions apply as usual.

If pages or documents should be available for semantic search can be set at page collection level for pages, and in document types for controlled documents. Semantic search does not work for other types of documents yet.

Very important! The semantic search will soon be developed further in Omnia but for now it does not support security trimming. Therefore, semantic search should only be used for common information that anyone in the organization have permission to read, for now.

This permission settings can be another way of restricting who can read information gathered by semantic search.
