User properties
===================================

The properties you want to use when creating Omnia users must be present in this list. These properties can also be shown on the customized user profile cards together with properties from Entra ID and SharePoint. Besides that, they will also be used to manage targeted mobile push notifications and statistics. Also note the comment about GDPR.

A number of default properties are always available. They can not be edited or deleted. If you need additional properties you add them here as described below.

Deleting a user property
**************************
When you delete a user property from this list, it's not deleted directly, it's moved to the property recycle bin, available under the tenant settings Properties.

(More infornamtion will be added soon).
