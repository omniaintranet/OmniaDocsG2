Synchronization
=============================================

Identity and user details sync from Entra ID are done here. You can also synchronize users and groups to Omnia search, if needed.

Omnia supports any custom user directory provider to synchronize groups and users into the system. Built-in providers are Microsoft Graph and Active Directory for Omnia on-prem.

**Note!** If mapping is needed, it's important that you set this up using the settings before synchronizing.

For Omnia search sync, a button for full sync and for reading logs are available.

Omnia search sync is normally fully automatic, nothing you should need to do manually.

FULL SYNC or FULL USER SYNC
*****************************
FULL SYNC syncs all properties for all users and groups. FULL USER SYNC syncs all properties for all users, but not for the groups.

(More information will be added soon).
