Dynamic groups - Tenant
===================================

Here dynamic groups can be created, edited and deleted. Dynamic security groups are based on user types, not on membership. They will replace and expand on the built-in groups “Internal users” and “External users” and can be used to protect information.

(More information will be added soon).
