Dynamic groups
===================================

Here you can create, edit, and delete dynamic groups. Dynamic security groups are based on user types, not on manual membership.

They replace and expand the built-in groups “Internal users” and “External users”, and can be used to protect information and control access across Omnia.

Active
***********
The Active list displays all currently used dynamic groups. From here, you can create new dynamic groups or edit the settings of existing ones.

Deleted
************
The Deleted list shows dynamic groups that have been removed but not yet purged from the system.
