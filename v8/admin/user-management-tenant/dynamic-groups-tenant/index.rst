Dynamic groups
===================================

Here dynamic groups can be created, edited and deleted. Dynamic security groups are based on user types, not on membership. They will replace and expand on the built-in groups “Internal users” and “External users” and can be used to protect information.

The list **Active** contains the dynamic groups that are presently being used. You can create new dynamic groups and edit settings for the groups there.

The list "Deleted" contains dynamic groups that have been deleted, but not yet purged from the system.
