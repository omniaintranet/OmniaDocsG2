Bulk create users
===================================

Use these settings to bulk create users in Omnia. The process has two main steps:

1. Select the user type and scenario.
2. Prepare and upload the template file.

Step 1: Select user type and scenario
***************************************
+ **User type** – You can bulk create users for one user type per session.

Note the **Undefined** option: If users imported from Microsoft Graph don’t match any existing rules, their user type is set to Undefined. You generally shouldn’t bulk create users of this type unless you specifically intend to.

+ Select bulk create users scenario – Choose whether to: Send onboarding links to all users of the selected type, skip sending onboarding links or automatically onboard users who already have assigned passwords.

Step 2: Edit the template file
*************************************
If you already have a template file, you can edit it and upload it for use in this session.

If not, download the default template and edit it using your preferred application for .csv files.

Each row in the file should represent one user to be created (onboarded). Do not modify the top row, as it contains column headers required for processing.

**Note**: If you use Microsoft Excel to edit the CSV file, make sure to select **Text to Columns** before making any changes.
