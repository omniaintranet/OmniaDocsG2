Users
===================================

This page describes the Users list in tenant user management. User management is also available for each business profile.

+ Users created within a business profile can be managed either in that profile (by a Business Profile Administrator) or here (by a Tenant Administrator).
+ Users created directly under the tenant can only be managed by a Tenant Administrator.

The Users list
*******************
Here, you can view all users in the tenant. You can add Omnia users (users who do not require a Microsoft 365 license) as well as edit or delete users created this way.

Use the search field to find specific users, and apply filters to narrow the list. You can sort the list by the following columns: Name, User type, and Provider.

Clicking a user’s name opens a preview of that user’s profile card.   

Filters
************
The following filters are available to display only selected users:

.. image:: users-tenant-filter.png

+ Time-limited – For user accounts with a defined duration, choose to list active or inactive accounts.
+ Status – Filter by enabled or disabled accounts.
+ User type – Display users by a specific registered user type.
+ Provider – Filter by provider, typically Microsoft Graph or Omnia.
+ Scope type – Choose which users to display based on scope: Tenant, Business Profile, or Group. If you select Business Profile or Group, you can then select the specific one as a second step.

**Tip**: To list only Omnia users created here, select **Omnia** under **Provider**.

Add a new Omnia user
*********************
You can add users in two ways:

+ Add a single user, or
+ Bulk create multiple users at once.
