Limitations for Omnia Users
===================================

Omnia users do not require a Microsoft 365 license. This also means that any functionality dependent on Microsoft 365 or SharePoint (as SharePoint is part of M365) cannot be used. 

Features unavailable for non-M365 users
*******************************************
The following areas of functionality are not available to users without an M365 license:

+ Teams functionality
+ Teamworks
+ Document management
+ Process management
+ Most aspects of search (see the Search block section below for details)

When creating pages—or more specifically, page templates—intended for Omnia users, it’s important to consider which blocks can be used. See the section below for details.

All other page-related functionality works as expected for Omnia users. However, keep in mind that permissions must be managed through Omnia Groups or Dynamic Groups for these users.
