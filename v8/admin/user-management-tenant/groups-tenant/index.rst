Groups
===================================

This view lists all groups in the tenant, allowing you to create and delete your own Omnia groups for security configurations.

You cannot modify Microsoft Graph groups, but you can view their members in the list.

If you are managing users for a business profile, groups can be created and edited in the same way. However, these groups are only valid within that specific business profile.

When editing an Omnia group, all settings are available—just as when adding a new group (see the link below).
For Microsoft Graph groups and users, only additional properties (if any) can be edited; information originating from Microsoft Graph cannot be changed.

You can sort the list by the Name or Provider columns. To display only Omnia groups, select “Omnia group” as the provider.
