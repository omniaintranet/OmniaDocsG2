Groups - Tenant
===================================

Here, all groups in the tenant are listed and you can create and delete your own Omnia groups for security setups. You can't change anything for a Microsoft Graph group, but you can see a list of members in the group. 

If you're working with User management for a business profile, groups can be created and edited the same way there, and are then valid for that business group only.

When you edit an Omnia group, all settings are available, as when you add a new group, see link below. Regarding groups and users from MS Graph, only added properties, if any, can be edited, not the information that originates from MS Graph.

You can sort the list on the "Name" and "Provider" columns. If you would like a list of the Omnia groups only, select "Omnia group" as provider.
