Create group
===================================

These settings are available when you create a new group.

Here you can add an image for the group using the Image picker, add a name and description and add Omnia users (members) to the group. The users must be added to the Users list first, to be available here.

You can also add users to the Owners group, if more than the tenant administrator should be able to edit the group. Users are added the same way to this group as to the Members group.

**********************
Omnia users and Entra ID users can be added to an Omnia group. Click the USERS button and add one or more users from the list.

If you selected a user by mistake, use the dust bin to remove the user from the group.
