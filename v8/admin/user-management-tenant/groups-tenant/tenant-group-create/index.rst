Create group
===================================

When creating a new group, the following settings are available:

+ Add an image for the group using the Media picker.
+ Enter a name and description.
+ Add Omnia users (members) to the group.

**Note**: Users must be added to the Users list first in order to appear here.

You can also assign Owners for the group.

If more than the tenant administrator should be able to edit the group, add additional users to the Owners group.

Users are added to the Owners group the same way as to the Members group.
