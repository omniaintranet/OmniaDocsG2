Create group - Tenant
===================================

These settings are available when you create a new group.

Here you can add an image for the group using the Image picker, add a name and description and add Omnia users (members) to the group. The users must be added to the Users list first, to be available here.

You can also add users to the Owners group, if more than the tenant administrator should be able to edit the group. Users are added the same way to this group as to the Members group.

The filter can be used to find one or more users in a long list. You can use these filter settings:

Add users to a group
**********************
Omnia users and Entra ID users can be added to an Omnia group. Click the USERS button and add one or more users from the list.

If you selected a user by mistake, use the dust bin to remove the user from the group.

Add groups to an Omnia group
******************************
You can add Omnia groups and Entra ID groups to an Omnia group (you can't add Omnia groups to an Entra group, though).

Click the GROUPS button and add one or more groups from the list.

You can use the pen to edit the groups's settings, if it's an Omnia group, or check the group's settings if it's an Entra ID group. Use the dust bin to remove the group from the group.
