User types
===================================

Every user in Omnia is assigned a user type. User types are also used when creating Omnia users and when setting up dynamic groups.

Authentication settings and user profile completion settings are configured per user type. Each user type can also have its own user card layout, if needed.

Edit or delete a user type
*******************************
Click a user type to edit its settings. All settings available when creating a user type can be modified here (see the links below for details).

You can also delete a user type while editing:

To modify the layout of the user card for a specific user type, click EDIT LAYOUT. See the link below for more information about editing layouts.

Create a New User Type

When creating a new user type:
*********************************
1. Add a title and a description.
2. Configure the other settings as needed (see links below for detailed information on each section).

**Tip**: You can create a new user type with just a title and description, then complete the other settings later.

When all settings are configured, click **Create** to save.

Manage the List
********************
When you choose to manage the list, you can use drag and drop to set the display order of user types. This order determines how user types appear in selection lists throughout Omnia.
