The properties that are selected (black) and not selected (blank), you can decide how to use. 

+ New: Only available when a new user is set up with this user type.
+ Edit: Only available when a user is edited.
+ Both: Available both for new and when editing.

Additional properties can also bed available under "Custom properties", for example:

They are used the same way as described above.

You can also manage the list, meaning using drag and drop to decide the order in which the properties are shown when creating a new user.
