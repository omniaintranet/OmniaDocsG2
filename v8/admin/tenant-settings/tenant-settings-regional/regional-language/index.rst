Language settings
=====================================

Use this setting to choose which languages should be available for the user interface in the tenant. These languages can also be used for announcements and shared links.

Note that language versions of pages are handled differently—variations are used for that purpose.

You can add or remove languages here at any time.

+ **Exclude Country**: Select this option if you don’t want a country flag displayed for the language in lists where users select a language.
+ **Language default**: There must always be one language set as the default.
+ **Languages**: All selected languages are listed here.

To add a new language:

1. Click the plus sign in the Languages list.
2. Select one or more languages.
3. Click ADD.

**Note**: The list of languages is long, but this does not guarantee that the interface is available in all of them. You must ensure that the interface has been translated into the languages you need.

4. Click **Save** when you're done.

Language displayed for a user
*******************************
The default language a user will see in the interface, announcements, and shared links depends on their preferred language setting in Entra ID. Users can change the interface language themselves in Omnia under **My profile**.
