App launcher settings
=====================================

You can create the impression that users remain within Microsoft 365 when entering Omnia by enabling the Omnia app launcher. It is fully configurable and appears in the same position as the Microsoft 365 app launcher. This is where you edit its settings.

+ **Enable**: Start by choosing whether to use the Omnia app launcher. If it is not enabled, the area will simply be empty.

Note that there is a tenant-level feature available to install default app launcher links, making it easy to get started with the Omnia app launcher.

When **App launcher** is selected, the following settings are available:

+ **Sorted by**: Choose how to sort the icons: *Custom*, *Alphabetical*, or *Last visited*. If you select *Custom*, use the **Custom sort** setting below to set the order (not shown for Alphabetical or Last visited).
+ **View template**: Choose how the icons are displayed: *Simple list*, *App icons*, *Navigation view*, or *App launcher*.
+ **Include mandatory links**: Select this option to display mandatory links.
+ **Include non-mandatory links**: Select this option to display non-mandatory links from the selected categories.
+ **Use targeting**: Targeting is set per link in the Shared Links sections—one at tenant level and one for the business profile. Here, choose whether to apply link-level targeting. Default = not selected, meaning targeting is not used.
+ **Include personal links**: Select this option to display the logged-in user’s personal links created in **My links**. Note that one or more categories containing personal links must also be selected below.
+ **Include following links**: Users can follow links in My links. Select this option to make followed links available in the App launcher. As above, ensure that one or more relevant categories are selected.
+ **No result text**: Enter a custom message to display if there are no links to show.
+ **Categories**: Select one or more link categories to include in the App launcher. Links are categorized when created, either at the tenant level or in the business profile.
+ **Item Limit**: Set how many links to show before **All apps** or a similar option is displayed.

Additional settings
**************************
