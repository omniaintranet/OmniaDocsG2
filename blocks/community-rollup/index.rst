Most options should be self-explanatory and besides that, a preview of your choices is shown in the block while you work with it. Comments on three options below:

+ **Mix card types**: Select this option if you would like an automatic mix of card types. Card types are remixed every time the page is loaded. If you click this option on and off a few times while you work with the settings, you can see the mix changing. If you select "Mixed" for "Layout", this option is not available.
+ **Static title size**: If the size of the title always should be the same on all cards, select this option.
+ **Colorful**: Available for some Layout options. It's really colorful! Try it and see what you think.

Filter
------------------
Filter options are the same in most blocks and are described on this page: :doc:`Filter options for blocks </blocks/general-block-settings/filter-options-block/index>`

Metric
*******
Using these settings you can show a metric in the block displaying the number of communities that is valid for the query settings. The metric can then be clicked to display the community rollup you have set up.

This can for example be used to create a rather compact page or section with different metrics in different blocks, that the user can use to click the desired metric to see the full list.
