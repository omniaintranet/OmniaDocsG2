Anchor navigation
=============================================

Use this block for navigation through anchors within a page. 

Here's an example of a anchor navigation:

The following settings are available:

Anchors
--------
Here you decide which anchors to use in the navigation.

+ **(First field)**: Select an anchor that are already created on the page and then click the plus. 
+ **REFRESH**: If automatic anchor creation is not used, editors have to click REFERSH after adding anchors to be able to add them to the navigation.
+ **Automatic anchor creation**: If this option is selected, anchors will automatically be added to the navigation while an editor works with text and creates anchors (for example for main headings).

Display
--------
Here you can edit some settings for the display of the navigation.

+ **(Top icons)**: Click the icon for the type of display you want. The first two icons should be self explanatory. The right-most icon is for a dropdown navigation, especially useful for mobile navigation.
+ **Sticky**: Select this option if you would like the navigation to always be shown when scrolling. Besides that, the navigation indicates where you are on the page.
+ **Item border**: (A description will be added soon).
+ **(Padding)**: Add some padding if needed.
+ **Font size**: Use the slider to set the font size of the navigation.
