The "List of requested by me" displays all sign-off requests the logged in administrator has sent, indicating what has happened so far. Here's an example:

.. image:: requests-admin-list-v7.png

The colored dots indicates the number of answers: white for none, yellow for some and green for all that the request was sent to.

Also note the NEW REQUEST link at the bottom of the list. That link can be used do create a new sign-off request the same way as in Omnia admin, see the "Requests" link below.

An "End-user sign-off" button is used to make it possible for users to sign-off a page by clicking the button. If there is a sign-off request for a page, the button will be shown there, otherwise not.

The purpose of "Create new request" is to make it possible to create a new sign-off request on any page. When creating the button, select type of request that should be possible to create. The sign-off types are set up in Omnia admin, see: :doc:`Sign-off request types </admin-settings/tenant-settings/sign-off-requests-613/sign-off-types-613/index>`

A new request can be created the same way as described on this page: :doc:`Requests </admin-settings/tenant-settings/sign-off-requests-613/sign-off-request-requests-613/index>`

It works the same way as in the Profile completion block: :doc:`The Profile completion block </blocks/user-profile-completion/index>`

(Only general settings for the button are available, see above).

This action can be added to the menu in a community but can also be added as a button on a page for a community or a publishing channel, with these settings:

+ **Subscription scope**: Select the scope here, meaning what the user actually subscribes to; the page in a community (= all changes to the page, even comments and best reply for knowledge pages), the publishing app, meaing the community app (= all new pages in the app, but not changes to existing pages) or the page collection for the community (= all new pages in the page collection, but not changes to existing pages). The scope can also be a publishing channel.

---------------------
The purpose of this button is to create a teamwork navigation, like the one that can be availble from the workspace header.

.. image:: teamwork-navigation-button-all-v75-frame.png

You can add categories (tabs) to display and you can work with a number of details for what is actually shown under each category. Using the option "Create teamwork" you can decide if it should be possible to create an app from here, and how it will work in that case.

Note that a category is basically a team collaboration rollup, so if you think along this line when you edit the settings for a category, you're on the right track.

You can add categories this way:

+ Click ADD.

The following settings are available:

.. image:: teamwork-navigation-button-add-settings-v7.png

These are the same settings as used when editing header settings for workspace. See the heading "Teamwork navigation - additional settings" on this page for more information: :doc:`Header for workspace </admin-settings/business-group-settings/workplace/header/index>`

The following is available under "Create teamwork":

.. image:: teamwork-navigation-button-add-create-v75.png

When the above option is selected, the following settings are available:

+ **Label**: You can add another label for the option if needed.
+ **Link**: If Omnia default settings are used, this field should be empty. If this link should other an other page than defaul, add the link here.
