Document rollup
===========================================

Using The Document rollup block you can display suitable documents in a list. 

For implementation examples, see this page: :doc:`Document rollup implementation examples </blocks/document-rollup/document-rollup-implementation/index>`

Settings
*************************
The following settings are available (image from Omnia 7.8):

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-all-78.png

The Analytics options can be available in Omnia 7.8 and later, if Matomo analytics is active in the tenant. More info at the bottom of the page.

General
-----------------
Here you can set the following:

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-general-new6.png

+ **Title**: If a title should be shown for the block, add it in this field. 
+ **Open in client app**: Documents are by default opened in the online app. If document should be opened in the client app instead, select this option.

Query
---------
You can either choose to pick documents to be displayed in the block, or use the Query Builder.

Pick ocuments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To pick documents, click "ADD DOCUMENT".

.. image:: document-rollup-pick-new2.png

The document picker opens and you use it to select documents. Available filters etc depend on settings in Omnia Admin. Here's an example:

.. image:: document-rollup-document-picker-77.png

See this page for more information on how to use the document picker: :doc:`The Document picker </general-assets//document-picker/index>`

Query builder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here you add queries, which is the detailed "settings" for what to display in the list:

1. Set scope for the document rollup: 

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-query-scope-new2.png

+ **All documents**: Always available, meaning ALL documents the logged in user has permissions to read. Use the query settings below to limit what will be shown in the rollup. The rollup can then be set to display just standard documents or both standard and controlled documents. To rollup documents from one or more teamsites, use this option.
+ **Published documents**: Available only if the feature Controlled documents is active. Meaning all published controlled documents the logged in user has permissions to read. Use the query settings below to limit what will be shown in the rollup.
+ **Archived documents**: Available only if the feature Controlled documents is active. Meaning all published controlled documents in the archive. As permissions to read documents in the archive normally is given to just a few. This is for specialized implementations.
+ **Process documents**: Available in Onia 7.8 and later. Available only if the feature Process managament is active. See below for more information. 
+ **Sharepoint library**: Available in Omnia 7.8 and later. You can choose to rollup all documents from a specific SharePoint library. When you have selected this option for the query, add the URL to the library in the field shown.

**Note!** Regardless of what you select here, the documents that will be displayed for a user are only those documents that the user has premissions to read.

2. Use the three lists for base settings and the field to add a query parameter. 

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-query-scope-settings.png

3. Click "Add" to add the Query. 

Note that you can type the script directly in the field, if you know how. You can use all options in the Keyword Query Language (KQL). See this Microsoft page for reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference

Additionally you can set:

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-query-scope-settings2.png

+ **Day limit**: Use this option to limit the display of older documents. You first select property (for example Modified) and then select how old the documents can be to be displayed in the list.
+ **Last modified by current user**: Use this option to limit the rollup to documents the logged in user has edited, for example for a "My latest documents" implementation.

Rolling up process documents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Available in Omnia 7.8 and later. Using the query option "Process documents" you can rollup controlled documents that have been added to a process. This is meant to replace the Process documents block for the same purpose as that block was used.

The primary usage is in a template for process pages. To list any documents a Process context block must be added to the same page so the document rollup "knows" which process to get the documents from.

Custom date filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the scope is filtered on some kind of time property, custom date filtering can be set.

See this page for more information about custom date filtering: :doc:`Custom date filtering </general-assets/custom-date-filtering/index>` 

A tip - rolling up drafts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you would like to rollup all controlled document drafts in the whole tenant, here's how.

1. Use Query builder.
2. Select "All documents".
3. Add the following KQL: ODMIsPublishedOWSBOOL:0 AND ODMIsPreviewOWSBOOL:0

Like this:

.. image:: rollup-drafts.png

Other filters can of course be used, for example to rollup all draft documents for a specific author or regarding a specific product, as long as you remember to select "All documents".

Display and filter settings are done the usual way.

Display
---------------
You can select "List view", "Summary view", "Group by site" and "Card" here. Available settings differ.

Analytics
************
It can be possible to use Matomo event tracking for documents, through a document rollup. It can be available in Omnia 7.8 and later, if analytics is active in the tenant. Also note that analytics data collecting must be on for the business profile for this to work, see the link to the analytics settings below.

.. image:: document-rollup-analytics.png

If activated, the following settings are available:

.. image:: document-rollup-analytics-settings.png

As you can see, what you can track is if a document in the rollup is opened and if a user sends feedback for a document.

For more information about how Matomo event tracking works and how to use the settings, see: :doc:`About Matomo event tracking </general-assets/about-matomo-event-tracking/index>`

Some settings are needed for every business profile where analytics data should be collected. Read about that here: :doc:`Analytics (Matomo) settings </admin-settings/business-group-settings/settings/analytics/index>`

Layout and Write
*********************
The WRITE Tab is not used here. The LAYOUT tab contains general settings, see: :doc:`General block settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`
