Event participant counter 
=================================

This block is used to show the number of participants that has registered for the event and the number of possible participants.

Here's an example when an Event is fully booked:

.. image:: event-management-counter.png

**Important note!** Event editors/admins can join events even though the max limit of participants has already been reached. The result can be that the number of registered participants seems to be higher than the max limit. If available seats in the image above would have been 21/20, it would simply have meant that an editor/admin also had joined the event.
