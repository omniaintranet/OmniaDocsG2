Posts block
=====================================

This block makes it possible to post conversation messages in an app. It can be used to implement a discussion within a community or a conversation within a teamwork.

It's also possible to aggregated messages from several sources and to post a message to a specific community, publishing app or teamwork app.

**Important Note**: To be able to post message in this block, a user must be added to or belong to a group added to the App contributors field for the app (found under Security in the app settings).

The following settings are available:

+ **Title**: Add a block title if needed.
+ **Current app**: If the scope should be this app only, select this option.
+ **Custom scope**: To set a different scope, select this option. See below for more information.
+ **Enable Mention**: If mentions should be possible in the posts, this option must be selected. Default=off.
+ **Allow social reactions**: Can be available if settings allow it. If it should be possible to use social reactions in this block, select this option. The same social reactions functionality as in Teams can then be used. The corresponding tenant feature must be activated for this option to be available.
+ **Allow likes**: If it should be able to like a comment, select this option. If the tenant feature "Social reactions" is activated, the "Allow social reactions" option replaces this option. Then social reactions is used instead of likes.
+ **Replies shown by default**: Decide the number of replies the should be shown for each post, before a "Show more" link is shown. Default=2. 

General note about Scope: Use Scope to set up which sources to get messages from, to show in this block.

Custom Scope
---------------
For Custom scope you can select Communities, Publishing apps or Teamwork apps. When this is done, select one or more in the next list. Messages from all selected communities or apps will then be shown in the block (but also see "Filter by followed" below).

These two options are also available:

+ **Filter by followed**: If only messages from the communities or apps the logged in user follows should be shown, select this option.
+ **Enable organization-wide posts**: In this context "organization-wide" means the whole business profile. Decide if it should be possible to post a message to another communitiy, publishing app or teamwork app in the business profile. You must see too that there is a receiving block somewhere for this option to actually do anything.

Style

This is available under Style:

If you would like to use custom style settings for this block, this is available:

Under "Advanced settings" you can find the following:

Should be self-explanatory. Just try them and see a preview in the block.

Tip - adding images to a post
******************************
Here's a tip that doesn't need any settings in this block:

If Omnia admin settings allow it, it can be possible to add images and animated gifs to a post, using these icons:
