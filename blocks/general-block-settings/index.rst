General block settings
===========================================

The Layout tab contains settings that are general for most blocks, but scoped for each block. 

Adding filters to a block, if it's possible, works the same for most blocks. Find a general description of how to do that here: :doc:`Filter options for blocks </blocks/general-block-settings/filter-options-block/index>`

The Layout tab contains the following settings:

+ **Anchor name**: You can set an anchor name for this block. When a block has an anchor name, you can link to the block, using a the Add Link block or using an action button. It's also possible to create navigation based om anchors.
+ **Icon type**: If you would like an icon to be shown for the block, the first step is to select icon type. (If you don't select an icon, Icon type has no effect).
+ **Icon**: After having selected icon type, then select the icon.
+ **Custom settings**: For Header you can choose to use the global settings (set up in Omnia admin) or use custom settings for this block.

Available custom settings for TEXT:

You can set these custom settings, for STYLE:

.. image:: layout-header-custom-style-v75.png

The options should be self explanatory.

These custom settings are available for ICON:

You can just try out different settings and see the effect in the block.

Targeting

A lot of blocks can be targeted to one or more users or groups using targeting properties. 

To target a block, open the settings for the block and select "Add targeting filter".
