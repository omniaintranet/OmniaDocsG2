+ **Status**: By using this option you can create rollups for pages with the status Never published, Published or Any status. 
+ **Trim duplicates**: If more than one Page Rollup block is added to a page, this option can be used to handle duplicates between the blocks. When the option is selected, you can enter a number indicating the priority for duplicates, for this block. If you set "1" for a block it means this block has priority showing a post that would have been a duplicate. 

More on scope Navigation path
---------------------------------
Navigation path is a special case, it's used for creating a navigation. When you have selected start node you can choose start node and navigation depth. There's also a view available, specifically for Navigation path; Navigation view. Select it under Display. It's only available if you first select Navigation path as Scope.

**A tip**: When you're creating a page type, selecting "Current node" for a Navigation path can be very useful. Wherever that page type is used, the view (Navigation view) always starts at the current node for that page.

Tip: Pages with a specific variation only
---------------------------------------------
If just pages with a certain variation (language or other variation) should be listed in the rollup, it can be done this way:

Page creation settings for Calendar display
--------------------------------------------
It's possible to create pages from the calendar view, useful for publishing campaigns, for example. To use this option, it must be activated and some settings needs to be done. They are found under the heading PAGE CREATION. You may also need/want to edit some settings in the page collection(s) where pages created from here are stored.

**Note!** You must still select something under Query for the Calendar display to be shown. You could for example just select "Tenant" as Scope.

**Note!** All permissions and all settings for the page collection where a new page is STORED always apply. That is true for which colleagues have permissions to create a page and settings for scheduled publishing and if approval is needed, for example.

.. image:: page-creation-option.png

When Enable page creation has been turned on, the following settings are available:

.. image:: page-creation-settings-more.png

+ **Title**: Add a title for the button used to create pages.
+ **Tooltip**: A tooltip for the button can be added here.
+ **Publishing app**: Choose a publishing app where a new page should be created. Select "Any publishing app" to let the author choose app.
+ **Page collection**: Shown when you have selected a publishing app. Select page collection within the app. You can choose "Any page collection" to let the author choose. When creating page templates, "Dynamic" is a useful option, as the template then can be used in different page collections.
+ **Set the default value from current page**: This is a suggested setting the author can change. If a default value for a property in the new pages, should be set from this page, select this option and then select property. This can be useful for rollup purposes, for example, when all new pages created from this view share a property value.
+ **Set the default date from the calendar**: This is also a suggested setting the author can change. This is simliar to the above, but concerning date properties. An example: if Article date is selected as property, the article date for the new page will be set from the calendar, the date that was clicked to create the new page.

When page creation from the calendar is set up, an author can create a page by clicking a date, and the option to create a page is available, for example:

.. image:: page-creation-settings-example-1.png

As the first step, the author selects where to add the new page. Available options depends on settings in the block. The author can also choose to edit the settings for "Set the default value from current page" and "Set the default date from the calendar".

In this example, settings in the block states that a new page should be created in the current publishing app and that the author can select page collection.

.. image:: page-creation-settings-example-2.png

After that, the creation of the page works as usual, see: :doc:`Create a page </pages/create-page/index>`

If the purpose is that new pages should be created (or rather published) on specific dates, for example for a campaign, scheduled publishing should be used.

See this page for information on how to activate scheduled publishing: :doc:`Page collection settings </pages/page-collections/page-collection-settings/index>`

See this page for information on how to use scheduled publishing: :doc:`Publish page changes </pages/publish-page-changes/index>`

Adding columns
----------------
For "List view" and "Event list", you have to add at least one column, for the display to work. Here's an example with three columns added for List view:

.. image:: list-view-columns-new3.png

This could show the following:

.. image:: list-view-example-new.png

Some examples and tips
-------------------------
"a month ago" etc is the "Social" setting for date. If you would like to show exact dates instead, select "Normal".

"Show paging" in settings for "Dynamic roller" makes these icons available for navigation:

.. image:: show-paging-dynamic-new.png

Here's a simple example of a Card view used for navigation purposes:

.. image:: card-view-example-pages.png

Card view can now display sub pages if the scope "Navigation path" is used. Here's an example:

.. image:: card-view-example-sub-pages.png

The card view also supports a dynamic number of properties that can be displayed on the card. Here's an example:

.. image:: pagerollup-cardview-terms.png

The Navigation view can be used to display a mega menu style navigation. Here's an example of a page rollup used for this purpose:

.. image:: navigation-view-mega-example.png

Style settings
----------------
For Roller, Dynamic roller and Card, extra style settings are available, for example (Card):

.. image:: page-roller-style-v75-1.png

and these:

.. image:: page-roller-style-v75-2.png

Most options should be self explanatory, just try out these settings. A preview is shown in the block.

A few notes, though:

+ **Mix card sizes**: When you select this option, the cards can be displayed with different sizes, which can change every time page is updated/opened. Note that you must have selected "Mixed" under "Layout" for this to work fully.
+ **Mix card types**: Select this option if you would like an automatic mix of card types. Card types are remixed every time the page is loaded. If you click this option on and off a few times while you work with the settings, you can see the mix changing. If you select "Mixed" for "Layout", this option is not available.
+ **Static title size**: If the size of the title always should be the same on all cards, select this option.
+ **Colorful**: Available for some Layout options. It's really colorful! Try it and see what you think.

Filter
-------
The filters available are the same in most blocks, see: :doc:`Filter options for blocks </blocks/general-block-settings/filter-options-block/index>`

Time Period
--------------
These settings where called "Social period" in earlier Omnia versions. The following settings are available here:

.. image:: page-rollup-settings-social-new3.png

Use these settings to decide the time period calculated for any of these options. If you don't select anything, it means "No limit". You can select one week, two weeks or one month instead.

Metric
*******
Using these settings you can show a metric in the block displaying the number of pages that is valid for the query settings. The metric can then be clicked to display the page rollup you have set up.

This can for example be used to create a rather compact page or section with different metrics in different blocks. The user can then click the desired metric to see the full list.

.. image:: page-rollup-metric-v75.png

+ **Show metric**: Select this to decide to show the metric (and the settings below becomes available).
+ **Title**: Add a title for the metric if needed.
