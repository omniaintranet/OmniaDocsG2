Profile completion (classic)
================================

Use this block to show the logged in user how far he or she has come towards completing the profile, if you use the older functionality for user profiles. 

In Omnia 7.7 and later, an alternative functionality for user profiles is added. It can now be set up for user types in User management on tenant level, and user profile card layouts can be created to allow the users to edit their profile card directly. For more information, see: :doc:`User types </admin-settings/tenant-settings/user-management/user-types/index>`

+ **Hide user name in text**: To not show the user name in the block, select this option.
+ **Hide percentage in text**: To not show the percentage in the text, select this. Note that the percentage is still shown in the circle.
+ **Size**: Select the size of the circle using this slider.
+ **Border size**: Select the thickness of the circle border using this slider.

Layout and Write
*********************
The WRITE Tab is not used here. The LAYOUT tab contains general settings, see: :doc:`General block settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`

Settings in Omnia Admin
**************************
All settings for the Strengthen profile content (classic) are done in Omnia admin. There you, for example, can set that a dialog should be shown in certain intervals, prompting the user to complete his or her profile.

For more information about these settings in Omnia admin, see: :doc:`User profile completion </admin-settings/tenant-settings/settings/user-profile-completion/index>`
