Task rollup
===========================================

This block can be used to show tasks assigned to the logged in user. Tasks from teamsites will always be shown. Tasks from Planner can also be added, if setup in Omnia.

**Note!** In Omnia on-prem, only SharePoint tasks are supported (Planner tasks are not).

All sites with tasks assigned to the user is displayed in a list. Here's an example with the list opened for one of the sites:
