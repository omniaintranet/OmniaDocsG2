Analytics table
========================

**This page is not valid. This block will be replaced very soon by another and the documentation will be updated.**

This is a new block in Omnia 7.6. Using this block you can display a list of pages in a business profile and see the usage.

Here's an example where the block is used in a governance hub with a lot of filter options:

Note that the block requires a fairly broad space to display all default columns in the list.
