Process library
===================================

**This page is just started.**

This block is simply the process library with all it's functionality, available as a block you can place on any publishing page or make available through a tab in Microsoft Teams. 

Just be aware that the block will need the full page width.

For more information about the functionality, see: (link to be added)

**Note!** Permissions works differently, see the comment below.

Settings
***********
The following settings are available for the block:

The settings are exactly the same, and works the same, as described on this page: (link to be added)

(Permissions described on that page do not apply when using Controlled documents library as a block, then the page's permissions apply).

Layout and Write
**********************
The WRITE tab is not used here. The Layout tab contains general settings, see: :doc:`General block settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`
