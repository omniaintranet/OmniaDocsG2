Calendar rollup
================

Use this block to display events from one or more calendars. Note that the calendars are based on Outlook or Exchange, it's not SharePoint calendars.

**Note!** In Omnia on-prem, only personal calendars are supported.

Note that a calendar rollup block can be targeted, see the common layout options: :doc:`General block settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`

Targeting and color for each calendar
--------------------------------------
Each calendar displayed in the block can be targeted and can be shown with a different color. These settings are available when you expand a calendar:

To select another color, open the list. You can select any of the pre defined colors, or add a custom one.

Targeting a calendar works the same way as in many other parts of Omnia. See this page for more information: :doc:`Using targeting </general-assets/targeting-in-omnia/index>`

You can always target the whole calendar rollup block as an alternative, if calendars should be shown for some and no calendars for others. See the link above.
