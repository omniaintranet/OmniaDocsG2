Media rollup
========================

This is a new block in Omnia 7.6. The purpose is to rollup different types of media resources for easy access, mainly for end users, but can also be configured to be of use for editors, for example if official images are located somewhere else than in any of the Central media locations.

Settings
***********
The following settings are available:

.. image:: media-rollup-settings.png

General
---------
Add a title for the block, if necessary.

Query
-------
Here you select the data source for the rollup.

You can rollup media files from a SharePoint library or you can use SharePoint search.

In both cases, start by selecting to rollup images, video or audio.

Media files from a SharePoint library
---------------------------------------
The next step for a Sharepoint library is to add a URL to the library (image will be replaced soon).

Media files through SharePoint search
-------------------------------------------
For SharePoint search you can add a query the same way as for many other blocks in Omnia:

Display
-----------
For display, you can choose a list view or a photowall view. For "List view" you must add at least one column for the rollup to work, and use these settings:

.. image:: media-rollup-settings-displat-list.png

If you select "Fixed header", the header is always shown when users scroll the list.

The rest of the options should be self explanatory.

**A tip!** If you would like to make it possible to download the media files in the list, there's a "Download" column you can add.

Here's a simple example of a list with a small preview and a download icon:

.. image:: media-rollup-settings-displat-list-example2.png

For photowall, these settings are avialable:

.. image:: media-rollup-settings-display-photowall-new.png

Use the option "Show property in overlay" to display for example the file name (Documents - Filename). When you have selected a property, you can decide if it should be shown as overlay all the time or only when in fokus (option "Show overlay in focus"). 

Here's an example of a photowall display with three columns (no overlay):

.. image:: media-rollup-settings-display-photowall-example-new.png

For a larger view, click a file. The media list can then be browsed this way:

.. image:: media-rollup-settings-display-photowall-example-browse.png

Note that the filename is always shown here when pointing at an image. There is now download option available for the photowall view.

Filter
----------
For filtering, common options are available. See this page for more information: :doc:`Filter options for blocks </blocks/general-block-settings/filter-options-block/index>`

Style
------------
Under "Style", you can set some padding.
