Media rollup
========================

This is a new block in Omnia 7.6. The purpose is to rollup different types of media resources for easy access.

**The documentaiton is just started with a preliminary description. More will be added soon.**

Settings
***********
The following settings are available:

You can rollup media files from a SharePoint library or you can use SharePoint search.

In both cases, select to rollup images, video or audio.

Media files from a SharePoint library
---------------------------------------
The next step for a Sharepoint library is to add a path to the SharePoint library, or just accept the default path (more info about this soon).

Media files through SharePoint search
-------------------------------------------
For SharePoint search you can add a query the same way as for many other blocks in Omnia:

Display
-----------
For display, you can choose a list view or a photowall view. For "List view" you must add at least one column for the rollup to work, and use these settings:

If you select "Fixed header", the header is always shown when users scroll the list.

The rest of the options should be self explanatory.

Here's a simple example of a list with a small preview:

For photowall, these settings are avilable:

.. image:: media-rollup-settings-display-photowall.png

Here's an example of a photowall display with three columns:

.. image:: media-rollup-settings-display-photowall-example.png

Filter
----------
For filtering, common options are available. See this page for more information: :doc:`Filter options for blocks </blocks/general-block-settings/filter-options-block/index>`

------------
Under "Style", you can set some padding.
