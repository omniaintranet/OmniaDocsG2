HTML/script
===========================================

HTML/script is a block you can use for various applications to add extra functionality or content to a page. One example is to add the code for a video, from YouTube, or some other source.

+ **CSS**: To set CSS for the content in this field, add it here.
+ **Javascript**: If Javascript is needed/used, add it here.

The HTML/script block supports api endpoints to the Microsoft Graph and SharePoint REST API. This will make it possible to get data from the Graph and render it using the built-in vue.js framework in Omnia.

Here's an example:

Using the HTML/script block on a section tab
****************************************************
There is a known problem that may occur when using this block on a section tab. You may have to disable lazy load, or the block won't work. This will eventually be fixed, but, for now, if you encounter this problem, simply disable lazy load. And to make sure, disable lazy load on all sections on the same levels as well, even if they don't contain HTML/script block.

This settings is found under "Advanced" in the settings for the section. For more information, see: :doc:`Settings for sections </pages/page-types/section-settings/index>`
