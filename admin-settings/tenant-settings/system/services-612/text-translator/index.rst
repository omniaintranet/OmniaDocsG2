Text translator
=======================================

A default translator is always available. No settings are needed to use the default translator. Azure cognitive services is also always available but to use it you need a payed subscription tp use it.

If you have installed a separate text translator, you also use this option to add the settings that are needed.

When you have a Azure cognitive services subscription, and if you have installed another text translator, you have to add some settings here:
