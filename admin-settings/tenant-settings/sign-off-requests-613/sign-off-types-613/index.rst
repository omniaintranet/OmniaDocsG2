Types
=============================================

Use this option to create, edit or remove types used for sign-off requests. A type is used to decide the property set available when creating a request. 

It works a bit differently depending on if one or several types are cretaed here. If just on type is created, it's used for all requests and there's simply no way to choose type when a request is created. If more than one type is created, it's mandatory to select type for the request.

If you have created any, they will be listed here:
