User properties
=============================================

The properties you want to use when creating Omnia users must be present in this list. These properties can also be shown on the customized user profile cards together with properties from Entra ID and SharePoint. Besides that, they will also be used to manage targeted mobile push notifications and statistics. Also note the comment about GDPR.

A number of default properties are always available. They can not be edited or deleted. If you need additional properties you add them here as described below.

Here's an example of user properties. The ones with a pen and a dust bin are added by an administrator.

The list of options at the bottom can differ depending on type of property. For more information, see below.

You can "lock" the settings for a property and then it can't be edited anywhere else but here. If a property is unlocked the settings can be edited in the Property block. Click the icon to lock or unlock.

Setup and Edit can be also be available, as here for a SharePoint term set.
