Limitations for Omnia users
===================================

Omnia users do not require a Microsoft 365 licence, and that means no options that are depending on Microsoft 365 or SharePoint (as it's a part of M365) can be used. 

These areas of functionality can not be used for non M365 users:

+ Teams functionality
+ Teamworks
+ Document management
+ Process management
+ Most aspects of search (but see the Search block below)  

When creating pages, or rather page templates, that will be used by Omnia users, it's important to consider which blocks to use, see below.

All other aspects regarding pages works well for Omnia users, but keep in mind that permissions must be handled through Omnia groups or Dynamic groups for these users.
