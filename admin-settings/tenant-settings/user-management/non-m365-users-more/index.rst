Limitations for Omnia users
===================================

**This page is just started.**

As mentioned, Omnia users do not require a Microsoft 365 licence, and that means no options that are depending on SharePoint or Microsoft 365 can be used. That includes, for example; Teams functionality, Teamworks, Document management, Process management and search.  

When creating pages, or rather page templates, that will be used by Omnia users, it's important to consider which blocks to use. No block that depends on SharePoint works for these users, at least not as intended, including rollups.

All other aspects regarding pages works well for Omnia users, but keep in mind that permissions must be handled through Omnia groups or Dynamic groups for these users.
