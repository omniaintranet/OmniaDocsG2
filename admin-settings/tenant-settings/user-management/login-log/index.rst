Login log
=============================================

Use this list, to keep track of logins and login attempts, for example useful if you suspect hacking attempts.

The list for the log can look like this (image from a test environment):

You can filter the list on Date - the last 7 days or the last 24 ours. You can browse or search for a specific user and filter on Status - successful or failed login.
