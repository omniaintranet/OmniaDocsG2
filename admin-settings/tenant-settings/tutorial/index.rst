Tutorial
=====================

Using this option in Omnia admin a tenant administrator can create and edit tutorials for selected publishing pages. 

A tutorial can be set up to start automatically when a page is opened. But if it's not, users select the "Tutorial" icon in the heading or in the menu.

**Note!** For the tutorial to start automatically, the tutorial must be set up in the action menu.

For an implementation example, see this page: :doc:`Tutorial implementation example </admin-settings/tenant-settings/tutorial/tutorial-implementation/index>`

When you have added an image for a step, you can edit or delete it the same way as you do for an image on a page.

Use the pen to edit, the X to delete the image.

For image editing, see this page: :doc:`Media picker </general-assets/media-picker/index>`

To add a page, do the following:

1. Click "Add Target".

.. image:: click-add-source-new2.png

Use these settings:

.. image:: source-settings2-new2.png

+ **Target type**: It's always Page, and it's already selected.
+ **Path**: Add or paste the path to the page here. **Note!** Only relative paths are supported.
+ **Start mode**: Select Start Mode here. Note that you can select different Start Modes for different pages, for the same Tutorial.

The following is available under "Start Mode":

.. image:: tutorial-start-mode-new.png

+ **Start the tutorial automatically**: The tutorial starts when the user enters the page, but when the user has closed the tutorial, it is still available as an icon or a menu option in the action menu.  
+ **User starts tutorial manually**: If the tutorial is made available through the action menu, either as an icon or in the menu, it can then be started manually or automatically. Note that this has to be set up as well in the Header settings for the business profile.
+ **Show alert for new version**. If the tutorials are available through an icon and a tutorial is updated, a Tool tip alert will be shown on the Tutorial icon. 

**Important note**: The tutorial must be available through the action menu, meaning set up as a menu option or as an icon, even if it should start automatically.

When you're done with a target setting, or with all target settings for a tutorial, use Add and Save this way:

.. image:: tutorial-add-save.png

+ **Add**: When you have entered the settings for a page, you must click "Add" to add the page to the list.
+ **Save**: When all sources are added, click here to save the source settings.

You can't edit a target, just add or delete. To delete, click the dust bin for the target.
