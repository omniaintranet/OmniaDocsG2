Allowing authors to add shapes
-------------------------------
Note that you can allow authors to add new shapes even when using a process template.

To make it possible for an author to draw shapes, select "Freeform" in the list.

**Important Note!** If the author should be able to add clickable areas to a background image, the process template must contain Freeform.

**Tip!** If you add a freeform shape intended for use for clickable areas on a background image, you should set the background colors to none, as such a freeform shape will have to be transparent.

To make it possible for an author to add images as shapes, select "Media" in the list.
