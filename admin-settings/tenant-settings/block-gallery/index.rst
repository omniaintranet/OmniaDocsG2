Block gallery
===================================

**This is a new option in Omnia 7.9. This description is preliminary and ongoing.**

In Omnia 7.9 and later, an alternative way of listing the sections and blocks is available - the block gallery. Here's an example:

You can now choose to use this or the classic view.

Block gallery options
***************************
The following options are available in Omnia admin:

Settings
----------
It's here you choose wether to use the block gallery view or the classic view:

.. image:: block-gallery-settings.png

Not much to it, if you would like to use the block gallery view in the tenant, activate "Modern 'Add content' dialog", if you would like to use the classic view, don't. If you make changes here, don't forget to save. The SAVE option is found at the bottom of the dialog.

Block templates
-----------------
If you opt to use the block gallery view, you can also create block templates, which is blocks with a number of pre defined settings, to make it easier for editors and can also be used to make sure certain blocks are setup the same way all over the tenant. The templates never replaces blocks, it's an addition.

Here's an example of a list with a number of templates created:

.. image:: block-gallery-templates-1.png

When you click CREATE TEMPLATE, the following settings can be used:

.. image:: block-gallery-templates-2.png

+ **Title**: Add a title for the list of templates.
+ **Description**: The description is displayed for editors, so it's important that it's clear what this template is about.
+ **Icon type/Icon**: Here you can choose to add an icon. Not mandatory.
+ **Definition**: Add the settings for the block template in this field.

Here's an example with definitions added:

To delete a a block template, just click DELETE, as seen at the top of the above image.

Block dialog
---------------
Some different block dialogues are available. There you can select which blocks should be available in that context, and set the order in which the block are shown. More information about this will be added soon.
