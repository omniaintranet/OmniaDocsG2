============================

The following settings are found here:

.. image:: security-tenant-v75.png

Users and groups
******************* 
Use this setting to add and remove tenant administrators and separate administrators for shared links and snnouncements, if needed. Only tenant administrators can use this setting. A tenant administrator can also edit all the settings for all business profiles within the tenant.

To delete an administrator in any of the lists, just click the x. To add an administrator, add the name the same way as in other name fields.

**Note!** There must always be at least one tenant administrator. If there is only one, that administrator can not be removed until an additional administrator has been added.

For more information on the people picker, see: :doc:`Using the people picker </general-assets/using-people-picker/index>`

Secrets
********
A number of settings are available under Secrets. Exactly what is available here depends on the implementation. Here's an example:

System Account
------------------
System account is a standard extension for specialized implementations only, normally used by developers.

**Note!** This way of using Azure AD synchronization is no longer supported by Microsoft (It's removed from Omnia 7.5 and later). You should execute syncronization as described here: :doc:`Azure AD Synchronization Settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/system/azure-ad-sync/index>`

Event Management service account
----------------------------------

If you will be using Event Management with a connection to calendars in Outlook, you must add the service account that will be used to read and write from the calendars in the tenant. (Don't forget that this account needs permissions to that calendar.)
