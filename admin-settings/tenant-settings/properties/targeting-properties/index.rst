Targeting properties
===========================

Here you define the properties to use for targeting. A list can look like this:

.. image:: targeting-properties-v7.png

The properties must be added to Enterprise properties to be able to be selected here, as well as be of the type "Taxonomy".

**Note!** Term sets to be used as properties for targeting in Omnia, must be set to "Available for tagging" in SharePoint.

**Note!** In Omnia on-prem, it's only possible to target using SharePoint User Profile and Windows Active Directory group membership.

***************************
To add a target property definition, click the plus and then use the following settings:

+ **Property**: Select tenant property from the list.

When you click the link, the term set for the property you have selected is displayed. Here's an example:

What you do here is to map terms from he term set, to groups. You don't need to map all, if you don't need all.

1. Click the term you want to map.
2. Select a group in the list by searching (type beginning of a group and see what pops up).

3. Continue this way until all terms you want to map is done. 
4. Save when you're finished.
