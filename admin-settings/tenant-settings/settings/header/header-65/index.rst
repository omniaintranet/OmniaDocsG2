App launcher
***************
You can create the feeling that when entering Omnia the user is still in Microsoft 365, by adding the Omnia app launcher. It's fully configurable. It's placed in the same position as the app launcher in Microsoft 365. Here you can edit the settings.

+ **Enable**: The first step is to decide to use the Omnia app launcher or not. If it's not enabled, the space is simply empty.

Note that there's a feature available for the tenant to install default app launcher links to make it really easy to get going with the Omnia app launcher. For more information, see: :doc:`Features - Tenant </admin-settings/tenant-settings/features/index>`

App launcher button
--------------------
Here you can set background color, icon color and hover color, if you're not happy with the default color settings.
