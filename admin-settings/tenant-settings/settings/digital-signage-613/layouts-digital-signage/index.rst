Layouts (Digital signage)
=============================================

Here you create layouts to be used for digital signage. You can use these layouts when you create screens for a web browser.

If there are some publishing layouts created, they will be listed here, for example:

.. image:: signage-layouts-78-50.png

To edit a layout, just click the name. All settings available when creating a new layout can be edited. Here's an example:

.. image:: signage-layouts-exanple-78.png

Regarding creating a new layout you do that almost exactly like other layouts in Omnia. Not all options may be applicable for Digital signage layouts, but it's up to you.
