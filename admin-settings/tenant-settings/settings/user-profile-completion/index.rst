Mapping Profile Images
-------------------------------------------------
If profile images are managed in another system (or in the SharePoint My Site, which is likely the case in an on-prem installation), you can use these options to map to that system, this way:

1. Create a Profile Image mapping, and then select "Add Mapping".
2. Select "SharePoint User Profile".
3. Select "Profile Picture" for "Type".
4. Select "Custom target".

7. Click OK.
