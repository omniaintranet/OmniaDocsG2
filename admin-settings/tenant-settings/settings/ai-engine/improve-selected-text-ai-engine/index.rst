******************************
The following are available for a new prompt setting:

.. image:: improve-selected-text-new-v75.png

+ **Title**: Add a title for this setting, in any available tenant language. Mandatory.
+ **Prompt**: Add the text (the instruction to OpenAI) for the prompt here. Note the message under the field. The token {Text} must be added here, within quotation marks. See below for an example.
+ **Open chat dialog**: If the chat dialog should open, select this option. This can be useful for editors, as they can continue communicating with OpenAI to make addtional changes.
+ **TRY OUT**: You can try out the settings by clicking this button.

Here's an example of a prompt:
