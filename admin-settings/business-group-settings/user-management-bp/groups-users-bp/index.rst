Groups - business profile
=============================================

This list displays groups for User management for the business profile. You can create, edit and delete groups here, if you are business profile administrator.

The options here works the same way as in User management for the tenant. There are only two major differences:

+ Groups set up in a business profile is valid for that business profile only.
+ The filter "Owner", available in the tenant list, is not available for a business profile, as this list can't show any users from another business profile.

For more detailed information on the various options, see: :doc:`Groups (tenant) </admin-settings/tenant-settings/user-management/groups/index>`
