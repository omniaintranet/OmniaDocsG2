Navigation bar
=================

Here you can edit navigation bar settings for the business profile's workspace. You can add different settings for the default navigation bar and for the navigation bar used in MS Teams. 

You can use several mega menu objects and several action menu objects, if needed.

When working with the layout, you can use all the sections and blocks that normally are available for pages, so the possibilities are almost endless. You can even add different layouts for different screen sizes, if needed, to fit for example both computer and mobile phone.

And here's how OUR ORGANIZATION is selected when any of these options is active:

.. image:: action-menu-add-settings-order-new.png

Working with the layout
*************************
You start your work with the layout by adding sections and blocks, the way this page describes: :doc:`Working with layouts </general-assets/working-with-layouts/index>`

**A tip:** One way of creating a mega menu-like navigation is to use a page rollup, with scope "Navigation path" and "Navigation view".

Different layouts for different screen sizes
----------------------------------------------
In addition to the options described above, you can add different layouts for different screen sizes, if needed.

The default screen size is for computer screens. You can use the other screen sizes to check what the layout will look like in smaller sizes, and decide if specific layouts for other sizes are needed.

If you would like to add different layouts for one or more of the other scren sizes available, do the following:

1. Select Screen size.

.. image:: layout-screen-size-new.png

2. Open the list and select "Create new layout".

.. image:: layout-screen-size-new-layout-new.png

You work with the layout for the different screen sizes as described above.
