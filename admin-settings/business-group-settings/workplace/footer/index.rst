Footer
=========

Here you can edit footer settings for the business profile's workspace.

Decide whether the position of the footer should be positioned at the bottom of the page (Absolute) or the bottom of the screen (Fixed). Then create  the footer using HTML/CSS and Javascript.

As an example, here's how it looks when you select HTML:

**Note!** In Omnia 7.8 and later, this footer can be enabled in connected SharePoint sites. It's a feature you can active for the sites where you want this. For more information, see: :doc:`Footer </admin-settings/business-group-settings/workplace/footer/index>`
