Teamwork templates
=======================================

Here you can work with templates for teamwork; Microsoft 365 group, SharePoint teamsite, Microsoft Teams, private Viva Engage (former Yammer) community and Facebook workplace group. In Omnia 7.6.41 and later, a Sharepoint communication site can be created either as a publishing app, or as a teamwork. This option is new for teamworks.

The first list displays all templates that has been created so far, for example:

.. image:: teamwork-templates-v7.png

The following actions are available in the dot menu for a template:

.. image:: teamwork-templates-dotmenu-v7.png

To edit a template, you can also just click the name. When you edit a template, all options that are described below are available.

You create templates for publishing apps, community sites and Teamwork the same way, see this page: :doc:`Creating app templates </general-assets/creating-app-templates/index>`

The settings for General, Properties and Custom steps are handled as described on the page linked above, even if available property sets and available features can differ. Available settings under Setup differ depending on type of teamwork. The differences are descibed here. A few additional settings for Policies are also described here.
