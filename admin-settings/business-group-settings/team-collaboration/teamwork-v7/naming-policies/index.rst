+ **Title**: Add a title for the policy here. Not shown for users.
+ **Prefix**: Here you can add one or more prefixes that should always be used when creating teamworks.
+ **Suffix**: Here you can add one or more suffixes that should always be used when creating teamworks.
+ **Blocked words**: If some words should not be used for teamwork names, add them here. 
+ **Preview**: Click here to test how this policy will work for the users when creating a teamwork.

+ **Title and Alias**: You can allow both title and alias to be used, or alias only.
+ **Fixed/App/User**: If you select "Fixed", you can add one or more words that will always be suggested as a prefix/suffix for all teamwork names. If you select "App", you can select a property for teamworks from the list, to be used as a prefix/suffix. If that property is mandatory, it can't be edited. If you select "User", you can select a user property from the list, to be used as a prefix/suffix. The property will be populated according to the logged in user creating the teamwork. If that property is mandatory, it can't be edited.

**Important note!** Naming policies for alias will not be applied to the SharePoint URL of teamworks based on a template of type Microsoft Teams.

Here's a naming policy for projects, as an example:
