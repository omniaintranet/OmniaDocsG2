Promoted search results
===========================

Based on search feedback, an administrator can create promoted search results in Omnia admin.

Whenever a user searches on any of the keywords of a promoted search result, it will be available here in advanced search:

.. image:: promoted-search-results-place.png

Or here in quick search:

.. image:: promoted-search-results-quick-new.png

You decide to enable/disable promoted search results in the settings for advanced search and for quick search, respectively.

You create a list of promoted search result to be used for both advanced search and quick search. Here's an example:

.. image:: promoted-search-results-list-new.png

To edit, click the pen. To delete, click the dust bin.

When you edit a promoted search result, the same settings are available as when creating a new one, see below.
