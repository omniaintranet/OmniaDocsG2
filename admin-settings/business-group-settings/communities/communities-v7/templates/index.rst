To edit a template, you can also just click the name. When you edit a template, all options that are described below are available.

You create templates for publishing apps, community sites and teamwork the same way, see this page: :doc:`Creating app templates in Omnia v7 </general-assets/creating-app-templates/index>`

All settings for Omnia community apps works as described on the page linked above, even if available property sets and available features can differ. Creating a template for a Viva Engage (former Yammer) community is slightly different. The differences are explained here.
