Layouts for publishing apps in Omnia v7
=============================================

Here you can create and edit layouts for publishing pages. If you're planning to add the possibility to work with controlled documents in a publishing app, you use this option to create a layout for that functionality, see the end of the page.

If there are some publishing layouts created, they will be listed here, for example:

.. image:: publishing-layouts-v7.png

The following actions are available in the dot menu for a layout:

To edit a layout, you can also just click the name. All settings available when creating a new layout can be edited, see below.
