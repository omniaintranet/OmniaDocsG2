Analytics (Matomo) settings
=============================================

Pre requisite: To use Matomo analytics, the tenant feature "Analytics core setup" must be activated, and for a business profile, the feature "Create new analytics website in Matomo" must be activated. 

No set up at tenant level is required.

In Omnia 7.7 analytics data is always collected separately for each business profile. In Omnia 7.8 a Matomo website can be shared between business profiles.

Matomo documentation is fully processed in ChatGPT, so you can use ChatGPT to ask about how to use various parts of Matomo functionality.

**Note!** All users that should have permission to see the analytics data must be added as Analytics readers: Business profil > Permissions > Users and groups > Analytics.

If you need to set up additional geolocation DBIP databases, see this page: :doc:`How to setup additional geolocation DBIP databases </admin-settings/business-group-settings/settings/analytics/set-up-dbip/index>`

These settings are available for Matomo analytics, in a business profile (image from Omnia 7.8):

+ **Matomo**: You can use the link shown here to go to the Matomo analytics page for this business profile.
+ **Enable data collection**: For Matomo analytics to work, this option must be selected. *Very important*: No historic data can be collected so it's important to enable this as early as possible, even before you have set up anyhting else regarding the analytics.
+ **Share website with other business profiles**: Available in Omnia 7.8 and later. To share this Matomo website with other business profiles, select this option. (More info about how this works will be added soon).
+ **Dimensions**: Here you decide what segments of analytics data to store for users. See more information below.

Add and remove dimensions
**************************
To add a dimension, do the following:

1. Select the property.
2. In the dimension list, select "Create dimension". If the dimension is already created, you can map another property to it.
3. Click the plus.

To remove a dimension, just click the dust bin. **Important!** Read the note at the bottom carefully! You can't delete a dimension once it has been set up, but you can rename it.

Here's an example of an analytics page. The dimensions set up in the image above are available here:
