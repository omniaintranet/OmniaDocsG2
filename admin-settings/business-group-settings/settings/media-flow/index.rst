Mediaflow
=============================================

To be able to use Medflow, there's a number of settings needed. See the heading "mediaflow" on this page: :doc:`Media picker </general-assets/media-picker/index>`

The settings here, are settings you MAY want to edit:

.. image:: mediaflow-setting.png

+ **Default language**: Here you can set the language used when browsing or searching for media files in Mediaflow, within the Media picker. It doesn't affect enything else. Use the ISO codes. If you, for example, would like Mediflow to use Swedish, type sv-se here.
+ **Limit to formats**: If you would like just certain image file types (jpg, png etc) to be available in Mediaflow, type the file types here, separated by a comma.
