Mediaflow settings
=============================================

To be able to use Mediaflow, there's a number of settings needed. See the heading "Mediaflow" on this page: :doc:`Media picker </general-assets/media-picker/index>`

The settings here, are settings you MAY need/want to edit:

.. image:: mediaflow-setting.png

+ **Default language**: In MediaFlow, the user's profile language is used, if that language is available in MediaFlow. Here you can add a default language to fall back to, if the user's profile language is not available in MediaFlow. At the moment English (en_US) or Swedish (sv_SE) can be used as fall back language.
+ **Limit to formats**: If just certain image file types (jpg, png etc) should be available in Mediaflow, type the file types here, separated by a comma.
