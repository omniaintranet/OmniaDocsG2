Layout settings
===========================================

**This description is just started. More will be added soon.**

Using layouts, available in Omnia 7.11 and later, you can decide how the tabs should look - for example selecting properties and settting the order. If needed, you can use different layouts for each business profile. 

**Note!** Working with layouts for the tabs in Omnia Feed is suitable for advanced administrators and developers. Also, if you plan to continue using the "old" way, the legacy way, of working with the tabs, you don't need to do anything here.

The following settings are available here:

.. image:: layout-settings.png
   
This is how you are meant to work with these options:

1. Add one or more previewers that can comment on the drafts and point out necessary changes, if needed.
2. Create one or more layout drafts.
3. Collect comments from the previewers.
4. Do final changes and publish the layouts.
5. Activate the layout engine migration.

**Note!** The layout engine migration can not be reversed for this business profile, once started, as stated in the text above the button. When the migration is completed, the Display settings for the tabs work differently. Now you select a layout there.

This is done for each business profiles, meaning you can choose to work the new way, with layouts, for some business profiles, and continue working the legacy way with other business profiles.

You can also share layouts between business profiles if you wish, to make sure the tabs look the same for some, or all, business profiles within the tenant - or simply use already created layouts as starting points for new layouts.

Creating new layouts
**********************
To create one or more new layouts, click the plus and use the following settings:

.. image:: new-layout.png

You can import a layout or select a layout template as a starting point, see below. One layouot template is always available, mirroring the legacy set of properties.

Layout settings
-----------------
Use these settings to create a new layout or edit a template or an imported layout:

+ **Title**: The title will be used in the list of layouts, and as the base for the file name, if the layout is exported.
+ **Page Types**: You can add one or more page types.
+ **Tab view settings**: Here you set up the tab view settings for the tab.
+ **Detail view settings**: Here you set up the detail view setting for the tab.
+ **Version history**: Each time you edit a layout and publish it, a new version is created. When there's more than one version, you can continue working on any version.

When all settings are done, don't forget to click CREATE to create a draft of the new layout. When the layout is finalized, you can publish the layout.
