Editing layout settings
**************************
When creating a new or editing a layout you can add a great number of settings for both Tab view settings and Detail view settings. You work the same way with both.

The work order is roughly:

1. Add one or more page types (mandatory).
2. Select a block and click ADD.

Additional settings for the block are now shown - different settings depending on typ of block. Here's an example for the Heading block:

.. image:: layout-heading-block.png

For several blocks you choose the property the get information from. For most blocks you can also add a custom style sheet if needed, if you now how to use Text style syntax for React Native: https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props

For a few blocks, you can select a number of child blocks to be displayed. Here's an example from the template with blocks and a custom style sheet:

.. image:: layout-heading-block-example-1.png

To edit a child block, click the pen. Now you can edit one or more child blocks and decide the view order, for example:

.. image:: layout-heading-block-example-2.png

As you can see, in this work view you can delete child blocks, but you can also add new child blocks.

You can edit any settings for a child block (differ between blocks). Here's an example of settings for a Heading child block:
