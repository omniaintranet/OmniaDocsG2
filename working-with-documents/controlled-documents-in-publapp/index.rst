Working with controlled documents in a publishing app
========================================================

It's possible to work with controlled documents in a publishing app. This is what is needed:

+ A publishing layout for this purpose.
+ Document picker categories set upp correctly.
+ Document management settings set up in the publishing app settings.
+ A menu option for controlled documents in the page menu (publishing app settings).

Here's an example with a layout for controlled documents:

You use it the same way as is described for publishing layouts.
