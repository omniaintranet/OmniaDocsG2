Authoring controlled documents
=================================

This section is intended for authors of controlled documents. The work normally takes place in a controlled documents library in a teamsite (but also see :doc:`Alternative ways of creating controlled documents </working-with-documents/alternative-create/index>`). 

Who is allowed to author and approve (if approval is needed) is set up in Omnia admin under Document management. See this page for more information on defining author permissions: :doc:`Document Mmanagement settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/document-management/settings/index>`

When a team site has been set up for controlled documents authoring, the following will be available for controlled document authors:

+ A documents library for controlled documents.
+ A send for comments workflow.
+ A publish workflow.
+ A tasks list.
+ Workflow history.
+ Document history for drafts.
+ Document history for the published editions.
+ Options for relating to other documents.
+ Options for relating to processes (if Process management is activated).
+ Options for creating a new draft from a published document.
+ Options for unpublishing a published document.

In a teamsite set up for controlled documents authoring, a library, usually called just "Controlled documents", is available here:

In the controlled documents library, authors can find three tabs:

+ **Drafts** is used when creating and editing drafts for new controlled documents or when updating an existing document for a new edition. Note that there are several options available for creating a new draft document, see below.

+ **Tasks** (if available) is a list of tasks for the documents – either for review or for publication – both active and finished.

+ **Published** display all published document in this controlled documents library. When a document is published it is removed from Drafts and is available on this tab. Here the options for creating a new draft, unpublishing and document history are available, together with a number of additional options.

Most headings can be used to sort a list. Available columns can be set up in many ways. You see one example in the image above.
