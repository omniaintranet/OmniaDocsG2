Related documents
====================

You can use this option to relate a controlled document to other controlled documents, as information that can be shown to document readers. This option can also be used to make sure someone, for example the document owner, will be notified when a new edition is published for any related document. Any published controlled document can be related to.

The number of related documents is shown to the right of the title. In this example Sustainability policy has 1 related document:

**Note!**
Relations between documents works just one way. If document A is related to document B, this is not shown for readers of document B. If document B should be related to document A as well, that has to be added for document B.
