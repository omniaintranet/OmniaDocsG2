+ **Title**: Change the title to be shown in the navigation. (The Title shown on the page or when searching will not be changed.) 
+ **URL**: The URL to the page is shown here. It can be edited if needed, but changing the URL must be considered as a rare case. You can also add a Teams URL here (click the Teams icon). The case is if you run Omnia from Teams, the URL you add here will then be used instead of the default URL. 
+ **Show in mega menu**: Per default the navigation node is shown in the mega menu (top menu). Deselect if you don't want to show it there.
+ **Show in current navigation**: Per default the navigation node is shown in the current navigation (left navigation). Deselect if you don't want to show it there.
+ **Open in new window**: Select this option if the link should be opened in a new browser window.
