Check page feedback
===============

If a Page feedback block is added to a page, or if a action button is added for this purpose, users can create feedback for the page.

To check the feedback, you need to be page author (= have permission to edit the page in Write mode).

To check out if any feedback is available, edit the page in Write mode, open the menu and select FEEDBACK.
