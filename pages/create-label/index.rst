Create label
========================================

In Omnia 7.10 and later you can create labels in the page navigation menu. It's for example useful if you need to add headings.

You create the label as a sub node to the node you have selected, just like when you create a page. You can also move the label in the menu the same way as moving a page.

When the label is created, you can create a sub page, a sub label, a sub link and use a few other options that works the same way as for pages:
