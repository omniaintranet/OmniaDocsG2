Create label (Navigation tree)
========================================

In Omnia 7.10 and later you can create labels in the page navigation menu. It's for example useful if you need to add headings. Note that you can't link to anything from a label.

You create the label as a sub node to the node you have selected, just like when you create a page. You can also move the label in the menu the same way as moving a page.

When the label is created, you can create a sub page, a sub label, a sub link and use a few other options that works the same way as for pages:
