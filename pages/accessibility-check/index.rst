Accessibility check when editing pages
========================================

Available in Omnia 7.10 and later. **(This description is preliminary)**.

When you are editing a page, you can use Preview mode to check for accessibility issues. This option is activated for each page collection, in the page collection settings.

If there are any issues, an icon is shown in the down right corner:
