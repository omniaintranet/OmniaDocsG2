Create a new page type
========================

This page describes how to create a local page type.

Note that if your organization works with tenant page types you first have to consider if you should add it as a tenant page type or a local page type. For more information, see this page: :doc:`Tenant page types </admin-settings/tenant-settings/webcontent-managament/page-types/index>`

1. Click the plus for Page types.

5. You then add blocks for the page's content.
