Page types
==================

Page types can be local, meaning available within a publishing app only, or for the whole tenant, so they can be used for any publishing app. Local page types are created and edited in the publishing app where they will be used. The tenant page types are created and edited in Omnia admin. Local page types can be converted to tenant page types, if needed.

If you are publishing app administrator you can work with local page types. A page type contains sections where blocks can be placed for content. Sections can be targeted.

Some blocks can be added to a page type so they are a part of the layout presented to editors of a page based on the page type.

Default content can be added to blocks and you can set if it's allowed to edit this content or not. This option is available for blocks that can be edited in Write mode. 

**Important note!** If default content in a block (text or image) is edited in the page type, that content is valid for new pages created from the page type only. That content is not updated in blocks in existing pages. 

When a new page is created, the editor or author can choose page type from any available in the page type list, it can be local page types or tenant page types, if any tenant page types are set up.

An unused page type can be archived (and then kept or deleted).
