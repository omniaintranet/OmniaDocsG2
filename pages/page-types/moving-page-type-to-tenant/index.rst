Moving a page type to tenant
=====================================

You can make a tenant page type of a local page type, for example so it can be used in other publishing apps. Here's how: 

Select the page type and choose "Promote to tenant" in the menu:

All pages using the promoted page type will continue using it, but the page type will now fully function as a tenant page type. (See for example the comment about updating a page type above).

**Note!** The promoted page type is removed from the list of local page types in the publishing app - it can no longer be edited there. As it is a tenant page type from now on, it must be edited in Omnia admin.
