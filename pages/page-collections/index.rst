Page collections
==================

Within a publishing app a number of page collections can exist, where some settings can differ, for example if approval of new pages are needed or not. 

A page collection contains, as the name imply, a number of pages.

If the feature “Default page collections and page types” has been activated, two page ollections has been created; Start and News. If needed, additional page collections can be created within the publishing app.
